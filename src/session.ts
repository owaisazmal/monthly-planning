/**
 * Where the auth session lives.
 *
 * Deliberately not AsyncStorage. AsyncStorage is plaintext on disk — a SQLite
 * row on Android, a file in the app container on iOS — readable from any debug
 * build with `adb run-as`, and from any release build on a rooted or
 * jailbroken device. That is fine for habit grids and fine for the name and
 * email in `auth.ts`; it is not fine for a credential that grants access to an
 * account.
 *
 * SecureStore puts the value in the iOS Keychain and the Android Keystore
 * instead, so it is encrypted at rest and tied to this app. `THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`
 * keeps it out of backups too: a restored phone starts signed out.
 *
 * What is exposed is a storage adapter rather than a token, because that is
 * what both candidate backends ask for and neither stores a bare token.
 * Supabase takes this object as `auth.storage`; Firebase takes it as the
 * argument to `getReactNativePersistence`. Either way the value written is a
 * JSON blob — access token, refresh token, the user record — which runs to
 * several kilobytes, and SecureStore documents a 2 KB ceiling per entry. So a
 * value is split across as many entries as it needs and reassembled on read;
 * the caller never sees the seams. Writes are not atomic across those entries,
 * so whichever client is used should be given its own lock (Supabase:
 * `lock: processLock`) rather than being allowed to write concurrently.
 *
 * Nothing calls this yet — there is no backend. Needs a native rebuild before
 * first use, since SecureStore ships native code.
