/**
 * Screen transitions, built on the Animated API alone.
 *
 * The app has no navigation library — screens are booleans in App.tsx — so this
 * is the smallest thing that makes those booleans move: one shared 0→1 value per
 * layer, driving both the screen coming in and the screen it covers, plus an
 * edge swipe that scrubs the same value by hand.
 *
 * Every screen in this app is transparent so the drifting aurora reads through
 * it, which rules out the usual push where an opaque card slides over what's
 * behind it — two transparent screens overlapping would just show both at once.
 * So the outgoing screen fades as it recedes, and is gone by the time the
 * incoming one is halfway in. What's left behind the new screen is the aurora,
 * which is what the design wants there anyway.
