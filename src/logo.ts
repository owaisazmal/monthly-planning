/**
 * The mark: the app's own radial tracker, caught mid-month.
 *
 * Twelve sectors — one per day, and twelve also reads as the months — and four
 * rings, one per habit with the first habit innermost, exactly as the tracker
 * draws them. The first eight days are marked, three of them missed, the rest
 * are still pending, and a slate tick sits outside the ring on the day that is
 * up next, the way the tracker picks out today's label in the accent colour.
 *
 * Pure geometry, no React: the in-app renderers draw it live, and the brand
 * assets committed under assets/logo were generated from these same numbers,
 * so the header, the launch animation and the app icon are the one shape.
